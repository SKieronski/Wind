# Wind
Wind is a running app! Create a running route based on a given distance, direction, and your location. See a list of all the routes you have saved to your account. Select a saved route to see all of its details. 

## Getting Started
This is a React Native app built for iOS so it is not deployed...yet!
Feel free to clone this repo and test it with your iOS or android simulators.

## End Point calculation reference
In this app, we use a formula derived from the Haversine formula to calculate the destination point given a start point, distance, and bearing. Please check out [Movable Type Scripts](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html) if you wish to learn more.
